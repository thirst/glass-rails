{"name":"Glass-Rails","tagline":"A DSL for building Google Glass apps using Ruby on Rails. ","body":"## Glass-Rails\r\n\r\nThis is a ruby gem extracted out of [Thirst Droplet](http://thirst.co/glass), a google glass application. The goal of this gem is to provide a more convenient wrapper around the official [Google Api Client for Ruby](https://github.com/google/google-api-ruby-client). This gem is still quite young, and in development, so keep posted for updates (and we also <3 pull requests). \r\n\r\n## Installation \r\nAdd the following to your Gemfile and then run `bundle install`.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem 'glass-rails'\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr you can install the gem locally, by running the following command in the terminal:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ gem install glass-rails\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Basic Setup\r\n\r\nIn order to get this gem setup for use, we require that you have some sort of user model already in place. You can, for example, have a `devise` generated User model, or a custom hand-rolled user model. \r\n\r\nFor convenience, this gem provides a command to scaffold some necessary files for glass development:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ rails g glass:install <optional_name_of_user_model>\r\n                       # defaults to 'User'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf the name of user model is not `User` then you must specify this when invoking the `glass:install` command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ rails g glass:install person\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Files created by the `glass:install` generator\r\n\r\n1. A `config/google-api-keys.yml` file for your client_id and client_secret api keys for accessing the mirror api.\r\n2. A Glass::Rails initializer file in `config/initializers/glass.rb` for setting up default view paths for your glass templates.\r\n3. Generates a `app/models/google_account.rb` model which is automatically associated to your user model.\r\n4. A controller is created for 'listening' to subscription notifications from your glass users. \r\n\r\n## Pre-defined Templates for Glass\r\n\r\nThis gem also includes pre-defined erb templates for use with timeline items. You can generate these templates for use by running the following command: \r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ rails g glass:templates\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will generate a name-spaced folder in your `app/views` directory called `glass` and populate it with a few useful predefined templates. \r\n\r\n## Creating Timeline Items \r\n\r\nThis gem also includes a generator for creating an ActiveRecord backed timeline item or a \"glass model\". \r\n\r\n## Glass::TimelineItem (a superclass which you'll be inheriting from)\r\n\r\nThe Glass::TimelineItem class is a subclass of ActiveRecord which is, for all intents and purposes, an abstract class. We've basically added a few convenience methods to ActiveRecord which allows for the easy population of custom menu items and some procedures for serializing these items for posting them to the glass timeline. \r\n\r\n### The TimelineItem Generator\r\n\r\nYou can generate a timeline_item model by executing the following command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ rails g glass:model <name of model>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, for the sake of illustration, let's say you wanted to generate a tweet model, which you intend to use to post particular tweets to a glass user's timeline. I would, then, execute this command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n$ rails g glass:model tweet\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would create a model for me in the following directory `app/models/glass/tweet.rb`. This `Glass::Tweet` model would inherit from `Glass::TimelineItem` and would therefore be accompanied by a sugary goodness which makes posting to glass timelines a ton easier. \r\n\r\n### Setting up a Glass Model\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n#### Defining a Default Template\r\nYou may want to specify a default template to use for a given timeline item. For example, if I had two timeline item models, `Glass::Tweet` and another `Glass::BasketballScore`, then I could specify a default template for the tweet model to use by using a helper_method in the class definition, like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Glass::Tweet < Glass::TimelineItem\r\n  defaults_template with: \"tweet.html.erb\" ## this path is relative to \r\n                                           ## your glass_templates_path, \r\n                                           ## which you can set in your\r\n                                           ## `config/initializers/glass.rb` \r\n                                           ## file.\r\n\r\nend\r\n```\r\nand then you could define another default template for your basketball score model like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Glass::BasketballScore < Glass::TimelineItem\r\n  defaults_template with: \"two_column.html.erb\" ## since this would make\r\n                                                ## sense if wanted to show \r\n                                                ## a score in each column.\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Defining Menu Items on the Timeline Item\r\n\r\nThis gem provides some meta-programming magic to ease the creation of both custom and built-in menu-items for glass, by providing an easy to use DSL for specifying custom and built-in menu-items that a timeline-item should have..\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say I want to have two default actions on my `Glass::Tweet` object: 1) email this tweet to me. 2) read the tweet to me aloud. \r\n\r\nInside my `Glass::Tweet` class definition, I would specify these actions like so:\r\n\r\n```ruby \r\nclass Glass::Tweet < Glass::TimelineItem\r\n  has_menu_item :email, icon_url: \"http://www.example.com/example-email-icon.png\",\r\n                        display_name: \"Email\", # this is what is shown \r\n                                               # as text for the menu item\r\n                        handles_with: :email_callback \r\n                                               # we'll ignore this for now.\r\n  has_menu_item :read_aloud ## this is a built-in action.\r\n\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would basically define two actions for all items posted with this glass model, i.e. Email & Read Aloud.\r\n\r\nYou can define a different set of menu items for each model, so that would probably be something to consider when architecting your glass app. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### Subscriptions / Notifications\r\n\r\nThe subscription/notification aspect of the mirror api is probably one of the most opaque aspects of the api (at least, in my opinion), but we've tried to include some tools to help get this part set up for you as well. \r\n\r\nBasically, you need to register a callback url for your glass subscriptions, and you will get notified when a glass user invokes a custom menu item. \r\n\r\nFor example, if a glass user activates the menu-item `email`, then our glass app would get pinged on our subscription notification callback url. From here, we've implemented a callback handler which allows you to easily manipulate any callback logic, in the comfort of your timeline item model. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, whenever you define a custom menu item using our helper method:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n  ..\r\n  has_menu_item :email, ..\r\n       ..\r\n       handles_with: :email_callback_method\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe've ensured that the method `email_callback_method` gets executed whenever your subscription notification callback url is pinged with the corresponding menu-item event. \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nThis framework is still young and being actively developed.
